# Gray Meadows

A complete rewrite of my personal desktop suite, with a Wayland desktop shell, and soon a greetd-based greeter. Originally in TypeScript + JSX, now in Rust and a bit of C++ (for thin FFI shims).

This will probably look like a mess for a while, this is more of a personal project for me to get back into Rust development, but I'll polish things up as I go.
